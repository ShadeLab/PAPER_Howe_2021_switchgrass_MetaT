Associated Methods in Paper:

Two metagenome assemblies, one for switchgrass and one for miscanthus, were created based on metagenomes collected in 2016.  These filtered metagenome reads were combined and used for co-assembly with MEGAHIT (v 1.2.9) using--kmin-1pass (low sequencing depth) and--presets meta-large (complex metagenome) (Li et al., 2015).   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/444212/161567338-2b6cf287-0e4c-477f-9d8e-ed85f01ba66f.png)
